"""Streaming line-level reader for Claude Code transcript JSONL files.

Every other module in this package reads a transcript through
``iter_lines`` so line handling — encoding tolerance, blank-line
skipping, unparsable-line and truncated-final-line counting, oversized-line
skipping, and Windows long-path handling — lives in exactly one place.

Streaming: ``iter_lines`` never reads the whole file into memory. It keeps
at most one line of lookahead (to tell whether the current line is the
file's last non-blank line, for truncated-final-line detection), so peak
memory stays proportional to the longest single line, not file size.
