"""Profile diff and apply-command rendering (plan Milestone v0.3's
``apply``/``--dry-run`` and ``docs/api.md``'s ``GET /api/profiles/<id>/diff``
-- both currently ``501`` stubs waiting on this module, per that route's
own note: "swapping the final ``_not_implemented(...)`` for the real
read/write is the only change needed once that module lands").

Every function here is a pure function of its arguments -- no filesystem
access, no import of ``cli.py``/``service/``/``snapshots.py`` -- matching
this project's established convention for exactly this situation
(``snapshots.py``'s module docstring: "this module takes ``snapshots``
as an explicit ... parameter ... rather than reaching out to load them
itself, so every function here stays a pure function of its
arguments"). The caller (a later work package's ``apply --dry-run`` CLI
path, or the service's diff route) is responsible for loading the
profile, the store's latest ``effective``/``effective_provenance``/
``effective_agents``/``managed_keys`` for the relevant project, and
handing them in as plain data -- exactly the shape ``snapshots.py``
already exposes (see ``docs/config-layers.md``).

Design choices made here, reported per this project's "report deviations
rather than making them silently" convention (``model.py``'s module
docstring):

- **``DiffRow.target_file`` (set by :func:`diff_against_effective`) names
  where a settings key is *currently* set** (derived from its
  ``provenance`` entry: ``"managed-settings.json"``,
  ``".claude/settings.local.json"``, ``".claude/settings.json"`` (repo,
  shared), or the ``"user settings"`` default when the key is not
  currently set anywhere or its provenance layer is ``"user"``/unknown).
  **:func:`render_unified_diff`'s ``scope`` argument is a separate,
  render-time choice of where to *write* the change** -- the caller's
  intended apply target, independent of where the value happens to live
  today (a profile might currently be user-scoped but the caller wants
  to render it as a project-local overlay instead). Only settings-kind
  rows are affected by ``scope``; a per-agent row always renders against
  ``.claude/agents/<name>.md`` regardless of scope (frontmatter is not a
  settings-layer concept), and an env row always renders as a name-only
  note (the plan's own A7 comment: "names only here; values supplied at
  apply time").
- **Managed rows are rendered as a trailing note block, not inside any
  ``---``/``+++`` hunk** ("excluded from the diff body" per this work
  package's brief) -- a caller applying the *rendered text* as if it
  were a real patch will never accidentally act on a line describing a
  key it has no power to change.
- **Rows where the current and proposed value already agree are kept in
  :class:`ProfileDiff` but never rendered** by :func:`render_unified_diff`
  (nothing to act on) -- a caller wanting the full current-vs-proposed
  picture (e.g. an API response) still gets every row from
  :func:`diff_against_effective`, only the *rendered* diff text is
  filtered to genuine changes, matching a real unified diff's own
  behaviour of never printing an unchanged line as a hunk.
