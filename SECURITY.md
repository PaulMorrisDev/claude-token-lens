# Security policy

claude-token-lens is a local, read-only analytics tool. This document is
a sign-off checklist for a corporate security review, written to be
verifiable against the code rather than taken on trust.

**Status note:** every guarantee below describes what the *current*
code does, verifiable against it rather than taken on trust. This
includes the `claude-token-lens serve` service (watcher, SQLite store,
JSON API, static web UI) and its deployment artefacts — see
[README.md's "Running the service"](README.md#14-running-the-service)
and [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md).

## What is read

- Claude Code transcript JSONL files under `<projects-root>/<slug>/
  <session>.jsonl`, `<session>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl` (+ sibling
  `.meta.json`), and `<session>/workflows/wf_*.json`.
- Claude Code configuration, via the `SessionStart` snapshot hook
  (`hooks/snapshot-config.py`): user and project `settings*.json` files
  (including `.claude/settings.local.json`), the platform's system-wide
  `managed-settings.json` (if present), agent frontmatter
  (`.claude/agents/*.md`), MCP server names, and enabled plugin names.
- Environment variable **names** matching `ANTHROPIC_*` / `CLAUDE_*` /
  `OTEL_*` (plus a short fixed list of irregularly-named levers) —
  never their values, with one exception: `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`,
  `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS`, `BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH`, and
  `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` are numeric caps, not secrets, so
  their integer value is recorded alongside the name.
- (Schema 2 — see [`docs/config-layers.md`](docs/config-layers.md) for
  the full field list) `~/.claude.json`, the CLI's own per-machine state
  file: matched to the current project by
  `os.path.normcase(os.path.realpath(...))` — the raw matching key is
  never stored — yielding MCP server/plugin names, small counts, and
  numeric per-project session totals (a cross-check against this tool's
  own accounting for the same session, joined by session id, never
  message text); and byte counts, file counts, and names only (never
  content) for the CLAUDE.md family, `.claude/rules/`,
  `.claude/commands/`, skills, `.mcp.json`, output styles, auto-memory,
  and installed plugins.

Nothing outside these locations is read, and nothing is ever written to
except claude-token-lens's own on-disk digest cache, config-snapshot
files, and usage log under `<config-dir>` (default
`~/.claude/token-lens`, or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/token-lens`).

## What is stored

Only numeric digests and short, non-identifying labels:

- Token counts, timestamps, model ids, tool names, event kinds, and up
  to a **40-character** Bash/PowerShell command prefix
  (`Turn.cmd_prefix`/`preceding_cmd_prefix`).
- Structural shape markers for anything not on an explicit allowlist:
  `dict(n)`, `list(n)`, `str(len)` — used by the config-snapshot hook for
  every settings/frontmatter value that isn't one of the small set of
  named-safe keys (`model`, `effortLevel`, `outputStyle`,
  `autoCompactWindow`, `autoCompactEnabled`, `promptCacheTtl`,
  `subagentPromptCacheTtl`, `cleanupPeriodDays`,
  `desktopSessionCleanupPeriodDays`, `autoUpdatesChannel`,
  `alwaysThinkingEnabled`) or a plain `bool`/`int`. Two further keys get
  their own safe summary shape instead of a raw value: `statusLine`
  (a bare present/absent boolean, never the command it runs) and
  `modelPricing` (a present flag plus the model ids it overrides, never
  the overridden numbers).

`Turn.read_target_hashes` is the one exception to "no path fragment is
ever stored", and it is deliberately a one-way hash rather than a
shortened/redacted string: for every `Read`/`Edit`/`Write`/
`NotebookEdit` tool call in a turn, `parse.py` stores
`hmac.new(salt, normcase(path), sha256).hexdigest()[:16]` — a 16-character
hex digest that lets the *same* file be recognised as re-read across
turns and sessions (for "which files does this session keep
re-opening" analytics) without the path itself, or any substring of it,
ever appearing in a dataclass field, the digest cache, or a rendered
report. The salt is a random 32-byte value generated once with
`secrets.token_bytes(32)` and stored at `<config-dir>/salt` (`0600`
permissions where the OS supports it); without a salt in effect
(`parse.set_salt` never called), `read_target_hashes` is always empty
rather than falling back to an unsalted, offline-crackable hash. Because
the hash is keyed to a salt private to one machine's `<config-dir>`, it
cannot be correlated against a hash produced on a different machine or
after the salt file is rotated/deleted.

Message text, tool-result content, file contents, full file paths and
full shell commands are never written to a dataclass field, the on-disk
cache, or any rendered output. This is enforced today by
`tests/test_privacy.py` (walks every field `parse_transcript` produces
and asserts no `str` field exceeds 64 characters outside a small named
allowlist, and that command-prefix fields never exceed 40) and
`tests/helpers.assert_privacy` (a second, shape-based scan every
privacy-relevant test fixture also runs, checking for a Windows drive
path, a POSIX `/home/` path, a `\Users\` path, an MSYS drive path, a
bare `@`, or a URL). Run it yourself:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_privacy.py tests/test_scrub.py -q
```

## No outbound network calls

No module outside `src/claude_token_lens/service/` imports a
networking library — no `socket`, `urllib`, `http.client`, `requests`
or equivalent anywhere else in `src/claude_token_lens/`. The package
has zero third-party dependencies (`pyproject.toml`'s
`dependencies = []`); `rich` is an optional, opt-in extra for nicer
terminal output, not a networking dependency. Pricing comes from a
user-edited local `pricing.toml`, never a live lookup — there is no
code path that could fetch it.

For the CLI's analytics/report subcommands this is a structural
guarantee: nothing to call out to, because there is no networking code
at all. **The `claude-token-lens serve` service** (a local
`http.server` API and static UI, `src/claude_token_lens/service/`) is
the one exception: `service/api.py` and `service/serve.py` do import
`http.server` (to listen on its own local socket) and `urllib.parse`
(to parse request query strings — it never builds or fetches a URL).
The service opens one socket — its own local HTTP bind,
`127.0.0.1`-only unless you pass `--allow-remote` — but never
initiates a connection of its own. This is an automated, always-on
guarantee, not just documentation:
`tests/test_service_egress.py` monkeypatches every socket-level call
that could originate an outbound connection or a DNS lookup —
`socket.socket.connect`, `socket.socket.connect_ex`,
`socket.create_connection` and `socket.getaddrinfo` — for the lifetime
of a real running server, and asserts every recorded target is the
test client's own loopback address, so any future change that adds an
outbound call or even resolves a remote hostname fails the suite. It has also
been verified against the built Docker image directly, independent of
the Python-level test: run with `--network none` (no network namespace
connectivity beyond loopback at all), the service still answers
`/api/health` correctly from inside the container — see
[docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md#verifying-no-egress) for the exact
commands. The Docker image adds defence in depth on top of that
guarantee (non-root user, read-only root filesystem, `cap_drop:
[ALL]`, `no-new-privileges`); the native Windows Scheduled Task and
systemd hosting paths are scoped instead by OS-level permissions
(`-RunLevel Limited`, `ProtectHome=read-only` plus a carved-out
`ReadWritePaths`) rather than a container boundary — detail on all
three in [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md).

The service's on-disk SQLite store (`<config-dir>/service.db`) is
always a derived cache rebuilt from the same transcripts the CLI
already reads, never a second source of truth — `claude-token-lens
serve --purge` deletes it safely at any time (it prints exactly which
files it will delete and requires `--yes` before doing so).

## Digest cache

`cache.py`'s on-disk cache stores one JSON file per transcript under
`<config-dir>/cache/<sha256 of normcase(realpath)>.json` — a
provenance header (mtime, size, schema/parser version) plus the same
privacy-clean `TranscriptResult` fields described above, never raw
transcript content. A transcript modified in the last 60 seconds is
never read from or written to the cache (it's still being written by an
active session). To purge it:

```bash
# POSIX
rm -rf ~/.claude/token-lens/cache
# Windows
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\token-lens\cache"
```

`--rebuild-cache` does this for you (purges the cache, then repopulates
it as it parses); `--no-cache` skips the cache entirely for that one run
without deleting anything already on disk. Both are wired through to
`corpus.load_corpus` for every subcommand that loads a corpus — see
[README.md](README.md#2-quick-start).

## Excluding confidential projects

`exclude_projects` in `<config-dir>/config.toml` is a list of slug
regexes (matched with `re.search`, case-insensitive); any project whose
slug matches is excluded from discovery entirely — never scanned, never
parsed, never appearing in a cache file — not merely hidden from
output. A malformed regex in the list is skipped, never fatal.

```toml
exclude_projects = ["^confidential-", "client-acme$"]
```

## Aggregate exports (`export`, `monthly-report`)

`claude-token-lens export` (`src/claude_token_lens/exports.py`) and
`claude-token-lens monthly-report` (`src/claude_token_lens/monthly.py`)
read the same in-memory corpus every other subcommand does — no
additional file access, no network access — and write only counts, token
totals, and costs; never a prompt, a tool result, or a file path.

- **Aggregate-only by default.** `export` defaults to one row per
  `(day, project, model, entrypoint, agent_type)`; `session_id` is only
  present when the caller explicitly passes `--per-session`
  (`exports.resolve_export_options`).
- **Project slugs are hashed by default whenever aggregate-only is in
  effect**, using the same salted `sha256(salt + slug)[:12]`
  construction and the same `<config-dir>/salt` file described under
  "What is stored" above (`parse.load_or_create_salt`, reused rather
  than a second salt) — never an unsalted hash, and never the raw slug
  unless `--no-hash-slugs` is passed explicitly. `--no-hash-slugs`
  together with `--aggregate-only` is honoured as the caller's own
  informed choice, not a default.
- **`otel-jsonl` carries no project/session attribute at all** — the
  OpenTelemetry metric names it mirrors (`claude_code.token.usage`,
  `claude_code.cost.usage`) don't have one, so `--aggregate-only`/
  `--hash-slugs` are moot for that format.
- **`monthly-report` never lowers the bar.** It calls `report.build_report`
  over a month-filtered corpus and inherits that function's own privacy
  properties; it adds no session ids, slugs, or text of its own — only
  numeric finance totals.

`tests/test_exports.py` exercises this with `tests/helpers.assert_privacy`
against the fully rendered export text (not just the in-memory rows) in
every format, plus explicit checks that no real session id string is
present in an aggregate-only export and that no raw slug string is
present when `--hash-slugs` is in effect. Full column-by-column detail:
[`docs/exports.md`](docs/exports.md).

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please open a private security advisory on the GitHub repository (or,
if that isn't available, open an issue asking for a private contact
channel) rather than a public issue, so a fix can land before the
details are public. Include the claude-token-lens version
(`claude-token-lens --version`), your OS, and — since transcripts are
never meant to leave your machine — a minimal *synthetic* reproduction
rather than a real transcript excerpt.
